# Seaborn_Plots

Here‚Äôs a clear and concise definition of common Seaborn (and related Matplotlib) plots include in my seaborn.ipynb file:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Line Plot
Definition: Displays data points connected by lines to show trends over a continuous variable (e.g., time).

Use Case: Tracking changes or patterns over intervals.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Bar Plot (Vertical & Horizontal)
Definition: Represents categorical data with rectangular bars whose lengths are proportional to their values.

Use Case: Comparing quantities across different categories.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pie Chart (via Matplotlib integration)
Definition: Circular chart divided into slices to show proportions of a whole.

Use Case: Showing percentage distribution.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Histogram
Definition: Groups continuous numerical data into bins and shows frequency counts for each bin.

Use Case: Understanding data distribution and spread.

5Ô∏è‚É£ KDE Plot (Kernel Density Estimate)
Definition: Smooth curve that estimates the probability density function of a continuous variable.

Use Case: Visualizing the distribution shape without binning.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Scatter Plot
Definition: Uses points to show the relationship between two numeric variables.

Use Case: Detecting patterns, trends, and correlations.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Box Plot (Whisker Plot)
Definition: Displays data distribution using quartiles, highlighting median, variability, and outliers.

Use Case: Comparing spreads between groups.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Violin Plot
Definition: Combines box plot and KDE to show distribution shape along with summary statistics.

Use Case: Comparing distribution shapes between categories.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Area Chart (via Matplotlib with Seaborn styling)
Definition: Similar to a line plot, but the area under the line is filled.

Use Case: Showing cumulative values or trends over time.

üîü Stack Plot (via Matplotlib with Seaborn styling)
Definition: Layered area chart showing multiple datasets stacked on top of each other.

Use Case: Visualizing how components contribute to a total over time.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Subplots & Grid Layouts
Definition: Multiple plots arranged in a grid within one figure.

Use Case: Comparing multiple variables or datasets side-by-side.
